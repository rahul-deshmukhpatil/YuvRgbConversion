These are ruby scripts for yuv and RGB conversion
**************************************************

you MUST have ruby installed on your system

To run any script, execute like following


$ruby ./yuv2rgb.rb 100 200 100 
#here 100 200 100 are the YUV values of the pixeli, repectively, to be converted into RGB range 


$ruby ./rgb2yuv.rb 100 200 100 
#here 100 200 100 are the RGB values of the pixeli, repectively, to be converted into YUV range 

The coeficients used for conversion are standard one, and taken from fourcc site.
